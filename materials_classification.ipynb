    "Many industrial robots today rely on rigid materials in order to handle heavy loads and precise tasks. However, when it comes to applications that involve human interaction, softer materials are more desirable since they are more human-friendly and less likely to cause injury, which is what has prompted many or the early efforts in soft robotics [[1]](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/308664/1-s2.0-S2352431618X00042/1-s2.0-S2352431617302316/am.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEDYaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIF5AUOvW9f9pyVbfd13hgicujXlcI1mlCH56fsf25xXEAiEAnZCSJwnk4lmmLcsBggetWgmpZ0Nyo13%2FuPBJ30Kud90qvAUIn%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARAFGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDAjqHEYoSF6upQQwxSqQBbyWTgiUMSAIvBRdhDINCBidNX5vuC7faDZZG19VnG9tyVuBvirHNX%2Bt9%2BgChASHQjXtkZcEkkJevyOwmZhOZkeVjIhbfVBWUDYTSQwwtfQrALAzBsPvUorsBGd%2BUx6iKtGuZCic8MI31efITQ18uOZpAJ2%2FBM7xbQjvjl94%2BoYqreDHZ3NaxtxxogbdtCo%2Bot3JdIMIIKCMOrOjyz2C86QcJCawTS6wP%2Bm5ss3r%2BiNOPT5jWoVT9FF81FQuDnI7toB%2BHMcyzhVG6ygXH3vgdUovmS5A7UYuBy54NfpFdst4GjRkUPSJous2Y1i%2BiiYsKuM%2BVTb0Xeft3ZX%2FdKa2zzoHKxyfLvBMJFqRL5znqRdqPoxWPl2mg8ewpTbnsItgPscS36UAsUaM2o6Byx9oW3XmIUejOwgFROFiMWmbQAhSA5dkVRTNr7FUDR504aAXb7pLF9kI4vqpFi8ZfnRAl3x7eIZb2WzHvh7Pz51KZCX6POd1eASNUKOYw3HBkqr7%2Bag2oAkeaDEZpkVChG1DHTloSTS%2F4mMKObOlPnJSgHG7WA9JxueIIM6KUxHChMs4VFxxyW7qi5bfinx2fhQZQAPClFZpJRdx0zzgVpR5eI0OyMQpsLkHoCs%2FPi7sse8mWQDpd9HkmKMrQpYrwoYGWLjeOF7zsM5PltNqXTN8UoIvQ8wRWrZb4hKdzEW5R6CEnpbVvh25r75T2bZXZRyHSLez4qHRX2vz6E8WZvoGuzFpnsJXzzkbq8QPiKr1BzPYA4GInTgfPDvoBjn2SNUyzEBkRLbtSflsCK96yirOlFuXkyx2DO8HMfojnwTxJqex0SQVhBJ1c93jC33v8sIxbPbD62SP%2Bn5uRNIA%2B0OWa%2BmJMKSvxasGOrEBadxx22kyiUuPZqYhTHrpMpphe%2F1VGeGxHajWO17nCZySYtPuLEa6AoyV%2FdISmKMilxHttN2S7F9LhoHqdEx0oLVG12u4ubkbz4S28n8yF%2Fk1PGEX6wvWKTZI9GhGPhOCUZRMtCYfCIKVHO74nrMvnnbaC4rN7pvAMva8rD0QbxUisKK6KRyf%2F%2BEis4p5sFVmjmlmEkx32mKrM54QIlHTO7CAGnk2Xq9roiRlOIm4G1zD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20231207T061841Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTYR6CWCXV7%2F20231207%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=f2779b7493c41df4a0543983f4ddd7f93acf34910d3735f8464f8cac31430c4c&hash=e2d2473e2abe5ee592f14b12f43d9fd020ec709f0c0ee14e0ebeaf884206afcd&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S2352431617302316&tid=pdf-50edf33a-02ba-4f0c-a6c9-1d157fd94230&sid=32c69ba61aef064eb70bd33213c82ff19b83gxrqa&type=client).\n",
    "Material selection can therefore greatly affect a soft robot's behaviour. Depending on the application, different properties will be desirable. One important property is the behaviour of a soft material under tension.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Soft Robotics Materials Database](https://github.com/LucMarechal/Soft-Robotics-Materials-Database) [[2]](https://github.com/LucMarechal/Soft-Robotics-Materials-Database) aims to aid in soft material selection by compiling the engineering and true stresses and strains of a material under tension. As this database grows, it would be useful to have build a tool that allows users to enter desired tensile properties and obtain the soft material that fits those properties. Given a small window of tensile properties, which material would exhibit the most similar tensile characteristics?\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this experiment is to classify a soft material under tension when given an arbitrary window of tensile data. The data used in this experiment consists of tensile test data for 19 different materials. For each material, the true stress, true strain, engineering stress, and engineering strain are collected over a time period at regular increments. If we take a small, continuous time window of the test results from a given material, can we predict which material is currently under tension using a logistic regression classifier?"

    "The first challenge of this problem lies in how to structure the data. Since we want to do classification over continuous time series data, we want to keep the continuity in a given data point, ie. if each data point consists of 3 measurements, they have to be time-consecutive. However, we still want to shuffle the training data as well as have the measurements in the test data be completely unseen by the model during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To meet the above requirements, the following steps were done during preprocessing for each material:\n",
    "- Remove (`test_split` * number of measurements) consecutive measurements at a random position in the data. This is to ensure that the test data will not always be from the beginning/middle/end section of the measurements.\n",
    "- For both the remaining train data and the extracted test data, overlapping windows of `interval` length were constructed as the inputs to the model, and labeled with the corresponding material under tension\n",
    "- Each data point was then flattened into a one dimensional array\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, an additional split of the training data is performed using scikit-learn's `train_test_split` to shuffle training data and make a validation split."

    "## Results and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above experiments, we can observe that the best performing model is a logistic regression model using `lbfgs` optimizer and no regularization. This could be due to regularization causing underfitting in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test accuracy was evaluated on the best performing model to be 95.11%, which indicates that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can thus conclude that logistic regression allows us to classify a material based on a consecutive window of 3 tensile measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGD optimizer was used for logistic regression as well, but offered significant decrease in accuracy. Several parameters such as learning rate type (adaptive, constant, optimal), initial learning rate, regularization type and regularization coefficient were evaluated but validation accuracy hovered around 40%.\n",
    "\n",
    "While SGD offered worse validation accuracy, it had a much quicker training time (up to 10s), whereas `lbfgs` took up to 10 minutes to train depending on the maximum number of iterations since it did not converge before reaching `max_iter`. It should also be noted that `lbfgs` sometimes terminated because it reached the maximum number of iterations without converging, yet still offered 94.71% validation accuracy and 95.11 test accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another notable finding is that a window as small as 3 consecutive measurements can already allow high accuracy when categorizing the material under tension."
